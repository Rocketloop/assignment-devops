# Engineering Assignment - DevOps

Please create a new repository on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/) with a Gitlab CI pipeline to test and dockerize [Django CMS](https://github.com/django-cms/django-cms). Note: You are welcome to use the Django CMS repository as a starting point. 

The resulting repository should have a pipeline which includes the follwing steps:

1.) Run all tests
2.) Calculate the test-coverage
3.) Create a docker image 
4.) Store the docker image in a docker registry

For our interview after completing this tasks, please prepare a concept (can be verbally) how you would deploy the project to a staging environment and how to handle database schema changes.
